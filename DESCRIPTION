Description: posibatch allows users to adjust for positional effects and batch effects in Illumina Beadchips. 
    Positional effects means the same sample in different physical positions on the array could be measured 
    as different methylation or expression levels, and batch effects. Batch effects are sub-groups of 
    measurements that have qualitatively different behaviour across conditions and are unrelated to 
    the biological or scientific variables in a study. It uses either parametric or non-parametric 
    empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for positional effects and batch effects. 
    Users are returned an expression or methylation matrix that has been corrected for position effects and 
    batch effects.
